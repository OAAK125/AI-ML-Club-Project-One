Student Grades prediction: 

Student academic performance is a critical aspect of educational systems, as it determines students' future career prospects and overall success. With the increasing availability of educational data, machine learning can be used to identify patterns and predictors of student academic success. In this project, we will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict student grades, enabling educators and policymakers to make data-driven decisions and implement targeted interventions to improve student outcomes.
